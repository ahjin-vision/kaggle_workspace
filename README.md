## 💁 About
This is about my self-study on **[Data Analysis and ML]** by using kaggle datasets. \
My work focuses on data analysis more than ML skills. \
I don't mind the scores or the leaderboard.  What I am trying to do is to make myself familiar to workflows in EDA and feature engineering. 😏 \
It contains my very own insights but I know it wouldn't be possible if I didn't referred to any of others' kernels. \
Thanks to many kagglers, especially to @YOU HAN LEE for making a good tutorial for beginners at his Youtube channel. 👍 \
\
Sometimes github coulnd't load the ipynbs, if it happens, please download the files and you could open it on local. \
I'm figuring out why it happens. \
\
Anybody is welcomed to make contributions, issues, anything about my work. \
Don't hesitate to mail me @ ahjin.vision@gmail.com \

And lastly, for all beginners, let's go for it!! 💪💪💪
